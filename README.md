# Obstacle Detection System for the Visually Impaired 🚶‍♂️📱

Welcome to the Obstacle Detection System project! This Android application is designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles in real-time and providing additional useful features.

### Project Overview
This project was developed as my final year project. The main goal is to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired users through advanced technologies.

#### Key Features
* Obstacle Detection 🚧: Utilizes MobileNet (TensorFlow Lite) to detect obstacles in real-time and alert the user.
* OCR System 🔍: Extracts text from images using Google's Machine Learning Kit.
* Barcode Scanner and Lookup 📦: Scans barcodes to extract the UPC code and retrieves product information using the Barcode Lookup API.
* Hands-Free Voice Memo 🎙️: Allows users to record and play voice memos for easy note-taking.
#### Technologies Used
* MobileNet (TensorFlow Lite) 📊: For real-time obstacle detection.
* Google's Machine Learning Kit 🤖: For OCR and barcode scanning.
* Barcode Lookup API 🔎: To fetch product information based on scanned barcodes.

#### How It Works
1. Obstacle Detection: The application uses the MobileNet model to process the camera feed and detect obstacles in the user's path. Alerts are provided through audio feedback.
2. OCR System: Users can take a picture of text, and the OCR system will extract and read out the text using Google's Machine Learning Kit.
3. Barcode Scanner and Lookup: The app scans the barcode of a product, extracts the UPC code, and retrieves detailed product information from the Barcode Lookup API.
4. Voice Memo Feature: Users can record and play voice memos hands-free, providing an easy way to take and access notes.

#### Installation and Setup
* Open the project in Android Studio.
* Build and run the application on your Android device.

#### Usage
* Obstacle Detection: Open the app and start the obstacle detection feature to receive real-time alerts about obstacles in your path.
* OCR System: Use the OCR feature to extract and read text from images.
* Barcode Scanner and Lookup: Scan product barcodes to retrieve detailed product information.
* Voice Memo Feature: Record and manage your voice memos easily.
